particular concern use headphone lot poor headphone amp quite problem behringer headphone amp ok specifically output impedance ohm rule thumb good headphone amp matching output impedance impedance headphone hd ohm impedance breaking rule get distortion frequency response case mostly meant attenuation bass manufacturer list output impedance possibly embarrassed anyway focusrite one reason trust little output impedance less ohm respectable not amazing still not low would need principle notice improvement bass response headphone plenty extra voltage could drive higher impedance can necessary
